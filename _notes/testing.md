# A. Wysiwyg presentation  
This is the maximum I can do with only CSS.   
The only veritable problem is with the Active-Line : Code mirror can’t have, at the same time, active line + Selection, so it will remove it and the selection will “twinkle”.   
In the same way, I can’t render the table as WYSIWYG but the plugin "advanced table" can help a lot to create table.  
  
I use, here :  
- Style Settings  
- Outliner   
- Yin and Yang theme
